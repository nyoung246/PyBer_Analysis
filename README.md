# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Omar in creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. A multiple line graph was also created to support this information showing the total weekly fares for each city type from January to April; this was to give the reader a visual aid when looking at the data. The calculations and results used to plot the multiple line graph is also included in this analysis.

## Results:

Looking at the summary DataFrame and multiplate line chart above, there are a few differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types as shown in the below points:
•	Rural cities have the lowest “Total Rides”, “Total Drivers” and “Total Fares”, whereas the Urban cities have the highest numbers in these areas from the months of January to April consistently.

•	Suburban cities are the only city type that have a upward slope in April, whereas Rural and Urban cities have a more gentle slope downwards. 

•	The “Average Fare per Driver” is substantially higher in Rural cities than in Urban cities with a difference of around $39 higher.

## Summary:  
Three business recommendations to the CEO addressing any disparities among the city types are shown in the below points:

•	The first recommendation would be to increase the total drivers for Rural cities. According to the analysis, it shows that Rural cities only have a total of 78 drivers, whereas the Urban cities have a total of 1625. Looking at the multiple line chart from the above, Urban cities are performing significantly and consistently better than Urban cities and this could be the prime reason why.

•	The second recommendation would be to increase advertisement in Rural cities. Pyber may not be as popular in Rural cities or there may be some competition in those areas. With an increase in advertisement, they may gain more customers.

•	The last recommendation is to implement a loyalty program to keep the current and new costumers coming back. This would form a relationship with the costumers and give them a reason to return and pick Pyber over any other competitors.
